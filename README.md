## About
<p align="center">
the goal of the game is to invest money in the slot machine, so that the crystals get into the line. This line can be both horizontal and vertical.</p>
<p align="center">
If the crystals do not line up, we lose the money invested.
If they line up, it's not enough that we do not have any money, but we also get the money invested multiplied by the number of lines.
</p>

## Example
